# Symlink all configs to their appropriate location in according to
# XDG Base Directory Specification.
# Symlinks will not be created if the link name already exists.
# General assumptions:
# * ~/.config dir exists and is populated with many other configs; don't try to
#   replace top-level ~/.config
# * Symlink the application top-level directory, not every file recursively in
#   it. Example: link ~/.vim/ and ~/.config/i3/ directories to their
#   appropriate locations.
# * Use 'find' in this directory, study the output and exclude anything that
#   isn't part of my system configuration.
