Using android studio on Arch
============================

Setup
-----

Install studio from AUR and (adb) tools from community:
yay -S android-studio android-tools android-udev

Local user must be in plugdev group, check with 'id' command.

Add user to adbusers group. Note: this differs from android developer for
Ubuntu instructions.
sudo usermod -aG adbusers $LOGNAME
Reboot machine to make sure udev rules are loaded properly.


Emulator
--------

Lots of flickering with i3 when tiling. Floating mode seems to work better.
i3 config has been tailored to put the emulator window to floating and position
on 3840p ultra wide monitor.

Running app on device
---------------------

Test access to Android device:
adb devices
--> must say no "permission denied" or "Unauthorized" (accept connection on device)
