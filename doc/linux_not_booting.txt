Recover broken Linux installation when boot fails
=================================================

Prepare a Linux live installation
---------------------------------

I used SystemRescueCd [http://www.system-rescue-cd.org/]
that I installed on USB stick using the provided Windows installation method.
SysRescueCd requires 1 GB storage.

Boot the live CD
----------------

Insert USB stick to the machine and boot. Look for the key to enter the boot
menu during the boot and select USB storage as the boot device.

SysRescueCd gives a few choices what to load, choose high-resolution console.

Follow the instructions on screen. Configure network if needed.

Setup chroot
------------

The following steps were stolen from
[https://aaronbonner.io/post/21103731114/chroot-into-a-broken-linux-install]

Mount root filesystem:
# mkdir /mnt/arch
# mount -t xfs /dev/sda2 /mnt/arch

Mount boot partition:
# mount -t exf4 /dev/sda1 /mnt/arch/boot

Mount special file system to chroot environment:
# mount -t proc none /mnt/arch/proc
# mount -o bind /dev /mnt/arch/dev
# mount -o bind /sys /mnt/arch/sys

Enable name resolution if needed:
# cp /etc/resolv.conf /mnt/arch/etc/resolv.conf

Login to chroot:
# chroot /mnt/arch /bin/bash
# source /etc/profile
