Updating slimrom image after the initial unlocking and flashing
===============================================================

Install Android debug bridge (adb) and fastboot
    - yaourt android-sdk-platform-tools
    - echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/android-sdk/platform-tools' >> \
      /etc/bash.bashrc

Assume root directory 'slimrom' for all content from here on.

Go to https://slimroms.org/#/
    - Check weekly news if there are any updates available
    - Make note of build fingerprint if the factory android image has been bumped
      to a newer version
    - Fingerprint can be also read from the extracted image content:
      grep fingerprint.*release-keys system/build.prop

Go to https://slimroms.org/#/download
    - Select HTC - flounder_lte
    - Download the zip archive

Go to https://developers.google.com/android/images#volantisg
    - Download the factory image matching the fingerprint

Go to http://opengapps.org/
    - Check for a newer gapps package
    - Select platform: ARM64, Android: 7.1 (or whatever slimrom is) and
      variant: nano

Go to https://twrp.me/htc/htcnexus9.html
    - If the fingerprint has changed, you'll probably need to check for latest
      recovery image as well
    - Download latest image from https://eu.dl.twrp.me/flounder
    - move the image under slimrom directory

Make a directory named according to the (weekly) release
    - mkdir slimrom/weekly-1.17
    - move the slimrom zip to the directory
    - move the android factory image to the directory

Extract the following images from factory image to the release directory
    - bootloader-flounder-* (in zip root directory)
    - vendor.img (inside another embedded zip)

Upload the slimrom image to the device while it's running normally
    - sudo adb push Slim-flounder_lte-7.1.2.build.*.zip /sdcard/Download

Upload GApps:
    - sudo adb push open_gapps-arm64-7.1-nano-*.zip /sdcard/Download

Enter fastboot mode
    - Manually:
      - turn off
      - press power button + volume down until menu appears
      - select fastboot using volume keys and enter with power button
    - or from using Android Debug Bridge:
      - sudo adb reboot bootloader

Prepare device for flashing
    - check fastboot is working and shows your device:
      sudo fastboot devices

Flash recovery image if a new version was available
    - sudo fastboot flash recovery twrp-*-flounder.img

Flash vendor and bootloader images
    - sudo fastboot flash vendor vendor.img
    - sudo fastboot flash bootloader booatloader-flounder-*.img

Enter the recovery progam twrp
    - While still being in 'FASTBOOT USB' mode,
    - Select 'HBOOT' and press power button
    - Select 'RECOVERY' and press power button

In case of clean installation
    - If the fingerprint changed it's best to do factory reset
    - select Wipe and factory reset by swiping the bottom slider
    - select advanced and check 'System' partition, wipe it

Flash the slimrom image
    - Select Install, browse to Download and slimrom image
    - Optionally include also gapps package
    - Wipe Dalvik and cache
    - twrp asks to install the app: say 'no' it's useful only for rooted device
