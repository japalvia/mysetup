Show information from VA-API driver
$ vainfo

Generally, VAAPI is used for Intel and Broadcom graphic cards, while VDPAU is
used for AMD/ATI and NVIDIA cards.

VDPAU is not available on Intel graphics
cards. Fortunately, there’s an open-source project called libvdpau-va-gl, which
is a VDPAU driver that uses OpenGL under the hood to accelerate drawing and
scaling, and VA-API (if available) to accelerate video decoding. You can use it
on some Intel chips.
