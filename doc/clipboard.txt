Clipboard using clipmenu
========================

clipmenud is run on Xorg startup and invoked by i3 window manager keyboard
bindings.

Delete all history:
clipdel -d .*

Test what would be deleted by a regex:
clipdel <regex>

Delete by regex:
clipdel -d <regex>


Recover clipmenud
-----------------

Sometimes clipmenud appears to stop storing (any) new entries. Remove
the runtime storage directory:
- By default $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is used:
    /run/user/1000/clipmenu.5./$USER
- TODO: debug clipmenud script why this works? Next clipmenud run creates the
  same directory so the name itself is not issue. Does systemd cleanup inode
  etc?
