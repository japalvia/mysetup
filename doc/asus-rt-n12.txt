The official firmware versions do some sanity/signature/etc checks and do not
accept uploading DD-WRT image directly from the web UI.

A working method is to downgrade to Asus firmware 3.0.0.4.374.813 (available
from Asus support page) and then install "mini rtx" followed by "mini bin".

Enter recovery mode:
- Connect computer with ethernet to router
- Configure a static IP address to the network interface: 192.168.1.2
- Turn off router
- Press and hold Reset button (a recessed button on left side of power)
- Turn on router
- Hold Reset until power led starts blinking slowly (5 sec interval)

Install Asus firmware 3.0.0.4.374.81 in Recovery mode:
- Open web browser to http://192.168.1.1
- Upload the firmware
- Wait for a few minutes to complete
- It's probably a good idea to do factory reset: hold Reset button until power
  led blinks and wait a few minutes that nvram is completely written

Install DD-WRT mini rtx in normal mode:
- Login to http://192.168.1.1
- Setup wizard requires first-time configuration but the upper-right corner
  button might let skip the wizard
- Click the firmware version link to go to the management page
- Upload the rtx image
- Wait for a few minutes

Factory reset after installing DD-WRT:
- Turn off the router
- Press and hold WPS button
- Turn on router
- Power led blinks, keep pressing 30 seconds (required time unknown)
- Release WPS button and wait for a few minutes

Install DD-WRT mini bin:
- Go to http://192.168.1.1
- If factory reset is successful the page requires setting admin credentials
- Navigate to firmware management and upload the firmare
- wait for a few minutes
- Repeat the factory reset as described above
