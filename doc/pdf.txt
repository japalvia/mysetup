Viewing PDFs
============

mupdf
-----

Supports loading the last accessed document page.

Useful keys:

Z       Zoom to fit document height or width (whichever comes first)
z       Reset zoom
m       Put position in stack
t       Load position from stack

C       Toggle full-page color tinting
I       invert colors for dark mode

Other vim-like controls:

123g    Go to page 123
g, G    First, last page
q       Quit
r       Reload document

mupdf-gl
--------

Support for saving history including last location and bookmarks
appears to be available only in -gl version. However, the upstream
freeglut does not support clipboard and the patches from mupdf
vendor are still pending/not accepted.

Workaround is to use the ghostscript version of freeglut:
https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=thirdparty-freeglut.git
Note: cloned as ~/ws/ghostscript-freeglut

Build mupdf from source:
- remove any existing mupdf* packages
- uninstall any existing mupdf in /usr/local

make prefix=/usr/local
sudo make prefix=/usr/local install
