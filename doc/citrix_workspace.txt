Citrix Workspace
================

Install from aur:
icaclient

Note that the installer script gives and example command how to copy template configs to your user
account.

A store or "discovery" url is needed to connect the service. This url can be found from Windows by
accessing the systray icon context menu preferences/settings. Note that the url is slightly
different from the web site when launched through downloaded ica file.

Run selfervice and enter the url:
/opt/Citrix/ICAClient/selfservice

Citrix behaves badly with (tiling) window manages such as i3. After running the receiver once there
should be file
~/.ICAClient/All_Regions.ini
Modify this according to:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/citrix#Troubleshooting

Launching app directly
/opt/Citrix/ICAClient/util/storebrowse --launch <app> --username <user> <url>

At this point <url> can be also found by:
/opt/Citrix/ICAClient/util/storebrowse --liststores

Enumerate all apps:
/opt/Citrix/ICAClient/util/storebrowse -E

Map local directory to H drive in remote host:
~/.ICAClient/wfclient.ini:DrivePathH=/some/path/citrix_share
