Reload after renaming or adding files:
systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart systemd-networkd

Debug .link file:
# SYSTEMD_LOG_LEVEL=debug udevadm test-builtin net_setup_link /sys/class/net/enp60s0u1u2

# udevadm info /sys/class/net/enp60s0u1u2

Renaming ethernet interfaces
----------------------------
Identify MAC address from 'ip adr' command
Setup .link and .network files normally
Generate initramfs because kernel sets the name very early:
mkinitcpio -P
Reboot

Remove all IP addresses from interface:
ip addr flush dev <interface>


Wireless using iwctl
--------------------

TODO: initial setup

Race condition with udev renaming active phy during boot:
https://insanity.industries/post/racefree-iwd/
https://iwd.wiki.kernel.org/interface_lifecycle

Workaround:
Find the interface name: wlan0
$ systemctl list-units |grep wlan0
  [..]
  sys-subsystem-net-devices-wlan0.device

Mark this unit as iwd's dependency:
$ systemctl edit iwd.service


Connecting to a known network, do a scan:
$ iwctl station wlan0 scan


Name resolution
---------------

Use systemd-resolved. Check that /etc/systemd/resolved.conf stub resolver is enabled and
/etc/resolv.conf is a symlink to run-time generated conf by resolved.

Status:
resolvectl


Proxy
-----

Chrome fails to connect services with F5 VPN connection and http proxy

Try adding name servers to the VPN tunneling link:
sudo resolvectl dns tun0 <nameserver> <nameserver>

Try to flush name cache:
chrome://net-internals/proxyservice.config#dns
