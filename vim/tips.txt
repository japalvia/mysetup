A collection of neat vim tips and tricks that I keep forgetting.
================================================================

Rename word under cursor, all instances. Alternative to :%s/foo/bar/g when foo
is lenghtly or needs escaping:
- put cursor on word
- press * to search for the next occurrence
- type 'ciw' (change inner word)
- type new word
- press esc
- press n for next occurrence and press . (repeat)
- keep pressing n + .

Search for byte values, e.g. null byte:
/[\x0]
